# **PRD — Comic Intro Scene**

## **Purpose**

This scene sets up the story in a comic book style, using panel-by-panel progression. It introduces Dr. Strange, explains the “space dust” premise, and gives Spider-Man (the chosen character) his mission.  
 Players advance the story by clicking/tapping, with each click turning the “comic page” to the next panel.

## **Gameplay Flow**

**Comic Page Layout**

* Panels appear left to right, top to bottom, like a comic book page.

* Each panel fills \~1/3 or 1/2 of the screen at a time, zoomed in.

* Players click/tap (or press a key) to advance to the next panel.

* **Style:** bold outlines, halftone dots, bright colors, word balloons, dramatic poses (matching the example comic page you uploaded).

## **Audio & Effects**

* Comic page flip sound each time you advance.

* Soft mystical hum behind Strange panels.

* Light city ambience (distant sirens, wind) behind Spider-Man panels.

* No voice acting — just text bubbles, but each appears with a “pop” effect.

## **Technical Notes for Cursor**

**Panel Navigation:**

* One click \= advance to next panel.

* Scripted sequence, always same order.

**Assets Needed:**

* Comic-style illustrations of Dr. Strange (4 poses: intro, close-up, map, dramatic warning).

* Comic-style illustrations of Spider-Man (2 poses: quip, shrug).

* Comic backgrounds (night NYC rooftop, space/magic background, East Village map).

* Text bubble assets with comic font.

* Page-flip transition asset.

**Style Consistency:**

* Match classic comic look (like uploaded reference): bold ink, halftone shading, strong primary colors.

✨ **Summary:**  
 The comic intro is now a **six-panel interactive sequence**.

After the last panel, the game cuts directly into **Level 1: East Village**.
