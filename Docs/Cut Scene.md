# **PRD — Mid-Game Comic Cut Scene (Between Level 1 & 2\)**

## **Purpose**

This cut scene rewards the player for completing Level 1, provides narrative continuity, and introduces the next mission location (Times Square). It uses the same **comic book style panel-by-panel progression** established in the intro, ensuring visual and tonal consistency.

## **Scene Breakdown**

**Panel 1 (Dr. Strange Congratulates)**  
 **Visuals:**

* Dr. Strange with cloak flowing, one hand raised in a magical gesture.

* Background: faintly glowing skyline silhouette of the East Village, with lingering sparkles (representing the dust being cleared).  
   **Text bubble:**  
   “Excellent work, Spider-Man. The East Village is safe — for now.”

**Player Action:** Click/tap to continue.

---

**Panel 2 (Spider-Man Quips)**  
 **Visuals:**

* Spider-Man crouched on a rooftop ledge, mask facing forward, casual pose (one hand waving like “no big deal”).

* Background: same rooftop skyline but more relaxed now (clear night sky, fewer effects).  
   **Text bubble:**  
   “Glad I could help. Got any other cosmic chores for me to run while I’m at it?”

**Player Action:** Click/tap to continue.

---

**Panel 3 (Dr. Strange Reveals Next Mission)**  
 **Visuals:**

* Close-up of Strange holding a glowing **magical map of NYC** again — this time **Times Square is glowing/pulsing red-purple**.

* Background: swirling magic glyphs and faint neon streaks (hinting at Times Square lights).  
   **Text bubble:**  
   “The dust has spread to Times Square. You must head there next — before chaos erupts.”

**Player Action:** Click/tap → transitions to **Level 2 loading screen**.

---

## **Audio & Effects**

* Page-flip transition between panels (same as intro).

* Subtle “magical shimmer” when Strange speaks.
