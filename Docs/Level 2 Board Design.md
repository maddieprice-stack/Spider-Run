# **Level 2 — Times Square Board (Design & Look)**

---

### **General Shape**

* Rectangular maze, horizontal (wider than tall).

* Enclosed by a **solid outer wall** (bright neon-blue lines, glowing effect).

* Layout is symmetrical — left half mirrors right half.

* Maze feels **denser** than Level 1: shorter lanes, sharper turns, fewer open areas.

---

### **The Central Area**

* Villain pen sits dead center, rectangular with:

  * Bright blue glowing outline.

  * Solid walls on all sides.

  * A **single-tile horizontal “door”** (bright white strip) at the **top and bottom**.

* Inside: 4 blank tiles for villain spawns.

* Player spawn (`S`) sits just below the pen, in open space.

---

### **Outer Border**

* Continuous bright-blue glowing line frames the maze.

* Inside this border runs a **dust-lined lane loop** for circling the edges.

* **Corner Web Shooters:**

  * 1 in each corner (4 total).

  * Appear as large glowing **red orbs** (distinct from white dust).

  * Flashing animation, pulsing glow.

* Corners feel **unsafe** because villains can access them quickly via short cut lanes.

---

### **Buildings & Lanes (The Big Visual Difference from Level 1\)**

**In Level 1 (East Village):**

* Buildings were solid blocky rectangles, muted dark-blue color, neat grid-like spacing (resembled simple apartment blocks).

**In Level 2 (Times Square):**

* Buildings/walls are **bright neon structures** instead of plain blocks.

* Use **multi-colored glowing edges** (red, purple, green, yellow neon outlines).

* Each “building” looks like a **billboard cluster or skyscraper chunk** rather than a dull wall.

* Design instruction:

  * **Outer walls:** Bright glowing blue (main Pac-Man wall color).

  * **Interior buildings:** Still solid (impassable), but their edges glow with **different neon hues** to create Times Square’s chaotic signage look.

  * Example: one rectangle outlined in neon pink, another in green, etc.

* Lanes between buildings are **narrower and jagged** — lots of short turns, sharp zig-zags, and dead-end traps.

* Vertical alleys connect top/middle/bottom but are more **fragmented**, forcing the player into tighter corners.

---

### **Special Features**

**Web Shooters (6 total):**

* 4 in corners.

* 2 extra along mid-lanes near the outer edges.

* Appear as **large flashing red orbs**, glowing stronger than normal dust.

**Dimensional Fragments (`T`):**

* Introduced in this level.

* Appear in risky intersections close to the villain pen and along mid-lanes.

* Visual: **crystal shards with rainbow glow**, pulsing effect.

* Gameplay: High-risk/high-reward pickup (villains can easily corner player near them).

**Hazards / Times Square Flavor:**

* **Blackout zones:** Electro effect flickers off light in an entire quadrant for \~3 seconds. Background turns fully black, only walls still glow faintly.

* **Crowd tiles:** Few mid-lanes overlaid with tiny pixelated “crowd sprites” (tiny dots that move slightly to suggest motion). These tiles slow player AND villains slightly.

* **Neon wall highlights:** Certain “buildings” outlined in pink, purple, or green neon flashing borders. (Purely visual but defines the chaos of Times Square).

---

### **Colors & Visual Palette**

* **Walls/outer border:** Bright glowing **blue**.

* **Buildings (inside walls):**

  * Solid blocks with **multicolored neon edges** (red, purple, green, yellow).

  * Must look like neon billboards/skyscraper clusters, **NOT plain bricks** like Level 1\.

* **Dust (pellets):** Small **white dots**.

* **Web Shooters:** Large glowing **red orbs** with pulsing animation.

* **Dimensional Fragments:** Rainbow-glowing shards (crystal-like).

* **Background:** Black void (to make neon pop).

* **Hazards:**

  * Blackout \= quadrant fades to total black (dust \+ pickups stay visible).

  * Crowds \= white/gray flickering “moving pixel groups.”

---

### **Overall Look & Feel**

* **Atmosphere:** Frenetic, overstimulating, “too many signs at once” — like walking into Times Square at midnight.

* **Visual difference vs. Level 1:**

  * Level 1 \= muted neighborhood blocks, cozy East Village vibe.

  * Level 2 \= dazzling neon chaos, billboards stacked on top of one another, **walls themselves are “signs.”**

* **Gameplay feel:** Harder, more dangerous: tighter choke points, less safe space, villains corner players faster, fragments tempt players into risky routes.

---

✨ **In short, Level 2 \= A neon-glowing Pac-Man maze that looks like Times Square.**

* Buildings \= skyscraper/billboard blocks glowing in different neon colors.

* Walls \= blue glow.

* Dust \= white.

* Pickups \= flashing red or rainbow shards.

* Hazards \= flickering blackout and crowd slowdown.
