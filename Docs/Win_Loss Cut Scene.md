# **Spider-Run: Win/Loss Quips & Game Over Rules**

## **Win Quips (Comic Speech Bubble at End of Level)**

* **Level 1 (East Village):**  
   *“Guess sweeping the streets really is my job…”*

* **Level 2 (Times Square):**  
   *“Bright lights, cleaner streets — you’re welcome, New York\!”*

(Future levels can follow this pattern: quick, funny one-liners that match the environment.)

---

## **Loss Quips (Comic Panel Overlay When Player Loses All Lives)**

* **Game Over (any level, lives \= 0):**

  * Spider-Man crouched, mask half torn, thought bubble:  
     *“Man… I really dropped the ball this time.”*

  * Optional randomized alternates for variety:

    * *“Note to self: dodging villains is harder than it looks.”*

    * *“Remind me to never tell Strange I messed this up…”*

    * *“Even heroes have bad days.”*

## **Game Over Rules**

* **Trigger Condition:**

  * Player loses all 3 lives (whether in Level 1, 2, or future levels).

  * Always overrides current level progress.

* **Visuals:**

  * Comic panel slides in (like a “final page” closing).

  * Black background with halftone effect.

  * Spider-Man slumped or crouched, dramatic pose.

  * Bold text: **“Game Over.”**

* **Options Displayed:**

  * **Retry:** Restart from Level 1 with full lives.

  * **Exit:** Return to title screen.

* **Audio:**

  * Background music fades out.

  * Dramatic sting (short orchestral crash or comic “thud”).

  * Quip appears as speech bubble *after* “Game Over” text lands.

✨ **Final Clarification:**

* **Winning** \= happens when all dust is cleared → Spider quip tied to environment.

* **Losing** \= happens when lives \= 0 → *always* cuts to universal **Game Over screen** with randomized Spider quip.

* Doesn’t matter whether the player dies in Level 1, Level 2, or beyond — **the same Game Over panel is used.**
