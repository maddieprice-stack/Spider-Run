# **Level 1 — East Village Board (Design & Look)**

### **General Shape**

* The board is a **rectangular maze**, longer side-to-side (horizontal) than it is tall.

* It’s enclosed by a **solid outer wall** (bright blue, like the classic Pac-Man look).

* The maze has a **symmetrical layout**: the left half mirrors the right half.

* In the very center is a **rectangular pen (cage)** where villains spawn. This is the visual “heart” of the board.

---

### **The Central Area**

* At the exact center sits the **villain pen**, a blocky rectangle with walls on all sides and a narrow horizontal “door” in the middle (top and bottom).

* The inside of the pen is empty, holding **four villain spawn spots**.

* Just below this pen, in the open street, is the **player’s starting tile**.

* The center area feels like a “hub,” with multiple short paths leading out to the sides and corners.

---

### **The Outer Border**

* The outermost edge is **one continuous wall** that frames the maze.

* Inside that wall runs a **continuous loop of dust-lined lanes**, so the player can circle the board along the edges.

* Each corner contains **power-ups (Web Shooters)** — large glowing dots, one in each of the four corners.

---

### **Lanes & Buildings**

* The maze is carved into **long horizontal lanes** broken up by **blocky rectangular buildings**.

* These “buildings” are solid wall clusters that break up the paths and force zig-zagging movement.

* Vertical alleys between these buildings connect the top, middle, and bottom halves.

* The look is very **grid-like and neat** — typical of a Pac-Man board, but styled to resemble tight East Village city blocks.

---

### **Special Features**

1. **Web Shooters (6 total):**

   * One in each corner (4).

   * Two mid-way between the center and edges (left side and right side).

   * Appear as larger, flashing dots.

2. **Taxi Stops (8 total):**

   * Small glowing icons placed near the outer lanes (two left, two right, plus a few mid-lane).

   * Give the board some NYC flavor — imagine a little yellow taxi sprite waiting on those tiles.

3. **Darkness Hazards:**

   * Certain areas (upper-left and lower-right quadrants) are fitted with **street lamps** that occasionally flicker out.

   * When lamps die, that quadrant goes dark for \~3 seconds. Player can still move but must do so blind.

---

### **Overall Look & Feel**

* **Color palette:** Blue maze walls, black background, white/gray dust, yellow taxis, red Web Shooters.

* **Atmosphere:** Feels like running through a pixelated, neon-lit neighborhood — not chaotic like Times Square, but cozy and blocky, like East Village streets at night.

* **Gameplay feel:** Easier, open design, longer straights with fewer choke points, to let the player learn the mechanics.

---

✨ So visually, think of this level like:

* A **blue neon rectangle** enclosing a tight East Village “street grid.”

* **Big glowing orbs** (Web Shooters) at the corners.

* **Tiny white dots** lining every street.

* **Yellow taxi tiles** that hint at speed boosts.

* **Darkened pockets** of the board where the streetlights flicker out.
